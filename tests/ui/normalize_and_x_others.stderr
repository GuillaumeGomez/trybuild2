  = help: the trait `Shr<&str>` is not implemented for `u8`
  = help: the following other types implement trait `Shr<Rhs>`:
            <&'a i128 as Shr<i128>>
            <&'a i128 as Shr<i16>>
            <&'a i128 as Shr<i32>>
            <&'a i128 as Shr<i64>>
            <&'a i128 as Shr<i8>>
            <&'a i128 as Shr<isize>>
            <&'a i128 as Shr<u128>>
            <&'a i128 as Shr<u16>>
          and $COUNT others
